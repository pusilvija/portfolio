      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a Python developer with experience in data engineering and a growing focus on full-stack web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past few years, I've worked primarily with Python in backend and data-related roles, gaining hands-on experience in data processing, automation, and building scalable scripts and tools. I have worked in data engineering environments, where I contributed to building and maintaining ETL pipelines, handling large datasets, and integrating data sources efficiently.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, I've shifted my focus toward full-stack development. I'm actively learning and building projects using <strong>Django</strong> for backend APIs and <strong>React</strong> for frontend interfaces. My goal is to combine my strong programming foundation with modern web technologies to deliver complete, end-to-end web solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy solving real-world problems by applying best practices, writing clean code, and embracing continuous learning.
